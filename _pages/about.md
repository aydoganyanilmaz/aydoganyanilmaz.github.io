Hi, I'm Aydogan Yanilmaz. Thanks for visiting! Below you can find a brief overview of my current whatabouts:

My academic life
======

I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu" target="_blank">Department of Linguistics</a> in <a href="www.stonybrook.edu" target="_blank">Stony Brook University</a>. Under the guidance of <a href="https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu/faculty/john.drury" target="_blank">John E. Drury</a>, I am studying the brain responses of the factors causing interference while parsing non-adjacent dependencies. My dissertation work is awarded by an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1730289&HistoricalAwards=false" target="_blank">NSF grant</a>.

I work as a freelance computational linguist. Lastly, I worked as a computational linguist at <a href="http://www.ntent.com/" target="_blank">NTENT</a> where I worked as a developer in semantic search for
