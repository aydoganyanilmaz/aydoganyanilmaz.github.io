Hi, I'm Aydogan Yanilmaz. Currently I am wearing several hats:

My academic life
======

I am a PhD candidate at the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu) in [Stony Brook University](www.stonybrook.edu). Under the guidance of [John E. Drury](https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu/faculty/john.drury), I am studying the brain responses of the factors causing interference while parsing non-adjacent dependencies. More about my [research](https://aydoganyanilmaz.github.io/research/). 

My industrial life
======

I am a computational linguist at [NTENT](http://www.ntent.com/) where I work as a developer in semantic search for 
natural language processing. I am designing computational patterns to dissolve ambiguity or
to rank query classification for relevant widgets. More about my NLP experience.  

Here is my [resume](https://aydoganyanilmaz.github.io/files/ay_cv_dec2017.pdf).
