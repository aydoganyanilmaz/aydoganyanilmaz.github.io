<p>Let me tell you my philosophy of teaching: <strong>I love teaching!</strong></p>
<p>Yes, as short as that! I simply love doing it. I get excited when I prepare a syllabus and do my best to pass that excitement to 
  the classroom throughout the semester. </p>
<h2><strong>Experience</strong></h2> 
<p> I taught a wide variety of courses in linguistics  </p>
<p>After a good education in teaching during my undergraduate degree at <a href="http://fle.metu.edu.tr/" style="color:#52adc8" target="_blank" 
                                                                            rel="noopener">METU FLE</a>, I had opportunity to teach in a variety of settings in my professional career. I started as an English instructor at the 
  <a href="http://dbe.atilim.edu.tr/?lang=en" style="color:#52adc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Basic English School of Atilim University</a> in Ankara, Turkey. Then, I started my master's at the 
  <a href="http://www.idb.hacettepe.edu.tr/En/main.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Linguistics at Hacettepe University</a> where I was offered Research Assistantship. Due to the lack of enough faculty, I taught some undergraduate linguistics courses such as
  "Languages of the World" and "Morphology". Then, my teaching life continued in the US when I started my PhD at SBU where I taught a wide 
  variey of Linguistics courses. Please check my <a href="http://www.idb.hacettepe.edu.tr/En/main.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resume</a> for the full list. Also, 
I've been lucky enough to work with amazing teaching role models namely <a href="https://aydoganyanilmaz.github.io/files/ay_cv_dec2017.pdf" style="color:#52adc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Larson</a>, <a href="https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu/faculty/john.bailyn" style="color:#52adc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Bailyn</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.idb.hacettepe.edu.tr/En/faculty-members.html"  style="color:#52adc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nalan B&uuml;y&uuml;kkantarcıoğlu</a>

<h2><strong>Experience</strong></h2>
