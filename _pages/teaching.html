<p>Let me tell you my philosophy of teaching: <strong>I love teaching!</strong></p>
<p>Yes, as short as that! I simply love doing it. I get excited when I prepare a syllabus and do my best to pass that excitement to the classroom throughout the semester.</p>
<h2><strong>Experience</strong></h2>
<p>After a good education in teaching during my undergraduate years at <a style="color: #52adc8;" href="http://fle.metu.edu.tr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">METU FLE</a>, I had opportunity to teach in a variety of settings in my professional career. I started as an English instructor at the <a style="color: #52adc8;" href="http://dbe.atilim.edu.tr/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Basic English School of Atilim University</a>. Then, I began my master's at the <a style="color: #52adc8;" href="http://www.idb.hacettepe.edu.tr/En/main.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Linguistics at Hacettepe University</a> where I was offered a Research Assistantship position. Due to the lack of faculty, I taught some undergraduate linguistics courses such as "Languages of the World" and "Morphology". Then, my teaching life continued in the US when I started my PhD at the <a style="color: #52adc8;" href="https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Department of Linguistics at SBU</a>.  I taught a wide variety of courses at SBU, as demonstrated in <a style="color: #52adc8;" href="https://aydoganyanilmaz.github.io/files/files/teachart.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> this diagram</a> and also verbalized more in my <a style="color: #52adc8;" href="https://aydoganyanilmaz.github.io/files/AY_CV_feb18.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> resume</a>. </p>


 Also, I should mention that I've been lucky enough to work with amazing teaching role models namely <a style="color: #52adc8;" href="https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu/faculty/richard.larson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Larson</a>, <a style="color: #52adc8;" href="https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu/faculty/john.bailyn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Bailyn</a>&nbsp;and <a style="color: #52adc8;" href="http://www.idb.hacettepe.edu.tr/En/faculty-members.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nalan B&uuml;y&uuml;kkantarcıoğlu</a></p>
