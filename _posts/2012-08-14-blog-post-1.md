My name is written as Aydoğan Yanılmaz in Turkish orthography. In IPA terms, it is pronounced as [ajdo(ɰ)ɑn janɯlmaz] in standard Turkish. However, I grew up being called [ajdoɣan] in my local dialect spoken in [Adıyaman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad%C4%B1yaman). Of course after moving to the US, I heard quite different varieties of my name, most incredible of which was [a:dəwa:].
