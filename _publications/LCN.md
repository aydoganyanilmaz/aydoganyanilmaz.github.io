ERPs were employed to examine the processing of NPI/licensor dependencies in Turkish. Previous
work on languages like English/German have documented intrusion effects, where structurally
ineligible licensors interfere with violation responses to unlicensed NPIs (a species of
“grammatical illusion”). Turkish makes it possible to test intrusion effects in environments where
NPIs precede their licensors and thus where intrusive licensors can intervene between NPIs and
legitimate licensors. We show that: (i) intrusion effects do arise in Turkish, (ii) that brain
responses at positions where intrusive licensors are encountered strongly resemble patterns
observed for conditions where licensing permissible (both situations reveal patterns seen for
other types of long-distance dependency processing, e.g. filler-gap relationships in
interrogatives), leading to (iii) attenuation of downstream violation responses. Accounts of
intrusion in terms of cue-based retrieval versus erroneous pragmatic licensing are discussed in
the context of these findings, underscoring the importance of cross-linguistic experimental work
